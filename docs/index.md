# Terragen

## Backdrop

* The idea of `Terragen` was born while reading and working on several other terraform providers.
* The initial version of the `Terragen` was just a one-time scaffold generator for Hashicorp terraform custom provider with limited features.
* While working on operators for Kubernetes bumped on to frameworks such as [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) and [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk).
* The idea for the latest version of `Terragen` is derived from such frameworks.

## Prerequisites
* [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.12 or above . Installing go can be found [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).
* Basic understanding of terraform provider and [creating](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/writing-custom-providers.html) one of them.

## Other Components

Other than project scaffolds, terragen generates additional files. Below are the list of those and its usage:
* `Makefile`: Along with regular scaffolds generated for a project, terragen generates makefile with minimal make targets to ease the development. 
* `terragem.yml`: This is a metadata generated by terragen to track all `created`/`updated` components and also project's compatibility with other versions of terragen.
